# dotenvhub

> Your Terminal App to manage your .env files

# Introduction
![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zaloog/dotenvhub/main/images/image_header.PNG)

DotEnvHub helps storing and accessing your project specific .env files from a central place to setup your environment variables.
Supporting you to follow the [12-factor] principles when developing applications.

# Features
- Organizes files centrally under `user_data_dir` following the [XDG] Basedir Spec
- Saves your last selected shell automatically via a config file under `user_config_dir`
- Supports Creating/Editing/Deleting files in your dotenvhub
- Currently provides 3 ways to set your environment variables:
  1. Copy the Shell specific command to set the environment variables into your clipboard
  2. Create a Copy of the selected file into your current working directory
  3. Copy the path of the selected file to be used with e.g. [python-dotenv] \
  without creating a copy in the project

# Installation
You can install dotenvhub with:
```bash
python -m pip install dotenvhub
```
Or using [pipx]
```bash
pipx install dotenvhub
```

# Usage
## Using the Graphical UI

After Installation the Interface can be opened with:
```bash
dot
```

## Using the CLI
The Creation of a Copy in the CWD and copying the Shell String
to set the environment variables can also be done directly in the CLI:

To create a copy of `FOLDER/FILE` from DotEnvHub and save it as `SAVENAME` in your CWD:
```bash
dot copy <FOLDER/FILE> -N <SAVENAME>
```

To copy the string to clipboard to set `FOLDER/FILE` from DotEnvHub in your `Shell` of Choice:
```bash
dot shell <FOLDER/FILE> -S <SHELL>
```

# Feedback and/or Issues
If you have feedback or find bugs, feel free to open an Issue.

:warning: DotEnvHub uses `pyperclip` to handle copy/paste actions.
Based on the pyperclips documentation, you might need additional packages installed
on linux systems like `xclip` or `xsel` which can be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xclip
sudo apt-get install xsel
```
